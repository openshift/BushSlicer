  Scenario Outline: limits backend pod max concurrent connections for unsecure, edge, reen route
    Given I have a project
    And I store an available router IP in the :router_ip clipboard
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/routing/routetimeout/httpbin-pod.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the pod named "httpbin-pod" becomes ready

    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <service> |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <route> |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash | -c | for i in {1..4} ; do curl -sS --resolve <resolve_str>:<%= cb.router_ip[0] %> <url>/delay/6 -k -I & done |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain 4 times:
      | 200 OK |

    When I run the :annotate client command with:
      | resource     | route        |
      | resourcename | <route_name> |
      | keyval       | haproxy.router.openshift.io/pod-concurrent-connections=<pass_num> |
    Then the step should succeed
    When I execute on the pod:
      | bash | -c | for i in {1..4} ; do curl -sS --resolve <resolve_str>:<%= cb.router_ip[0] %> <url>/delay/6 -k -I & done |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain <pass_num> times:
      | 200 OK |
    And the output should contain <fail_num> times:
      | 503 Service Unavailable |

      | route_type | route_name | service | route | resolve_str | url | pass_num | fail_num |
