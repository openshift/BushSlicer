= How to use user pools with the user pool manager

== Overview

To allow easier sharing of environment users, verification-tests supports putting
users into a user pool using a generic locker/allocator web app and then
reserving and releasing locks over the users as there is a demand for it.

The `env.api_endpoint_url` is used as a `namespace` for the lock and the user
credentials are used as a `resource`. This allows to use same pool for
different environments as they will be differentiated by `namespace`. e.g.
if you have a testing LDAP server, you can create a pool of LDAP users,
then use same pool with different environments without confusion between the
OpenShift environments.

== Deploy the OwnThat locker app

* see https://github.com/openshift-qe/ownthat

== add app to your private config

[source,yaml]
----
  ownthat_allocator:
    url: https://ownthat.example.com
    http_opts:
      user: user
      password: password
      verify_ssl: 1
----

== create some pools of users

* go to https://ownthat.example.com/pools
* use the Web UI to create entries - pool name, resource, active and note

Because the OwnThat app is generic purpose, the convention is to put into
`resource` the user credentials. That would be `username:password` or
`:tokenstring` in case user is identified by a token only.

Only active entries will be used for creating actual locks later. You can
use the note field to clarify origin of the user or reason why it is not
active. In any case the `note` field is irrelevant for verification-tests and is only
meant to serve human users that manage the pools.

=== launching Cucumber

The key points are to have `OPENSHIFT_ENV_<ENV>_USER_MANAGER` unset, empty
or set to `auto`. The other thing is to have users set to `pool:<pool name>`.


[source,bash]
----
...
export VERIFICATION_TESTS_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=ocp
export OPENSHIFT_ENV_OCP_USER_MANAGER=auto # this might be default already
export OPENSHIFT_ENV_OCP_USER_MANAGER_USERS=pool:mypool
cucumber <opts>
