= Cucumber based blackbox testing framework for OpenShift

== Getting started

More info you can find in link:doc/overview.adoc[Overview document].

=== Create local dev environment

. Install git if not installed already, install ruby 2.4+ if not installed
. git clone git@github.com:openshift/verification-tests.git
. cd verification-tests
. tools/install_os_deps.sh # need sudo; you may need to login again to terminal if ruby was installed via rvm during this phase
. tools/hack_bundle.rb # normal user
. install OKD or OpenShift Container Platform client tools

=== Update local dev environment

----
bundle update
----

=== Test scenario execution

Check link:doc/configuration.adoc[Configuring a BushSlicer v3 run]

This is an example:

----
export BUSHSLICER_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=ose
export OPENSHIFT_ENV_OSE_HOSTS=<host1>:etcd:master:node,<host2>:node,...
export OPENSHIFT_ENV_OSE_USER_MANAGER_USERS=user1:redhat,user2:redhat
# execute a whole feature file
bundle exec cucumber features/cli/create.feature
# or execute a single scenario
bundle exec cucumber features/cli/create.feature:5
# or execute the smoke tests
bundle exec cucumber --tags @smoke
----

For Origin environment, add the following environment variables:

----
export BUSHSLICER_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=origin
export OPENSHIFT_ENV_ORIGIN_HOSTS=<host1>:etcd:master:node,<host2>:node,...
export OPENSHIFT_ENV_ORIGIN_USER_MANAGER_USERS=user1:redhat,user2:redhat
----

You can check which environments are defined in link:config/config.yaml[config/config.yaml].

You could also use the BUSHSLICER_CONFIG variable to override other
configuration options. Add YAML/JSON into it and it will be merged with
configuration file.

=== Debugging failures

If any step fails, you will fall into a `pry` shell where you can investigate what's going on. This behavior depends on Cucumber profile that you enable during execution.

. running steps using `step 'Step name'`
. inspecting the `@result` variable
. calling and methods in World

=== Running tests from outside this repository

You can put your private test scenarios under `features/tierN` directory.
It is in link:.gitignore[.gitignore] so that you can keep your test scenarios under the same file system tree without git messing them up.
